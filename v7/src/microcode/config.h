/* Operating System / Machine dependencies:

   For each implementation, be sure to specify FASL_INTERNAL_FORMAT.
   Make sure that there is an appropriate FASL_<machine name>.
   If there isn't, add one to the list below.

   If you do not know the values of the parameters specified below,
   try compiling and running the Wsize program ("make Wsize" if on a
   unix variant).  It may not run, but if it does, it will probably
   compute the correct information.

   Note that the C type void is used in the sources.  If your version
   of C does not have this type, you should bypass it.  This can be
   done by inserting the preprocessor command '#define void' in this
   file, under the heading for your kind of machine.

   These parameters MUST be specified (and are computed by Wsize):

   CHAR_BIT is the size of a character in bits.

   FLOATING_ALIGNMENT should be defined ONLY if the system requires
   floating point numbers (double) to be aligned more strictly than
   SCHEME_OBJECTs (unsigned long).  The value must be a mask of the
   low order bits which are required to be zero for the storage
   address.  For example, a value of 0x7 requires octabyte alignment
   on a machine where addresses are specified in bytes.  The alignment
   must be an integral multiple of the length of a long.

   VAX_BYTE_ORDER should be defined ONLY if the least significant byte
   of a longword in memory lies at the lowest address, not defined
   otherwise (i.e. Motorola MC68020, with opposite convention, or
   PDP-10 with word addressing).

   Other flags (the safe option is NOT to define them, which will
   sacrifice speed for safety):

   HEAP_IN_LOW_MEMORY should be defined if malloc returns the lowest
   available memory and thus all addresses will fit in the datum portion
   of a Scheme object.  The datum portion of a Scheme object is 8 bits
   less than the length of a C long.

   b32 says that objects are 32 bits long.  The information is
   redundant, but some C compilers do not do constant folding when
   shifts are involved, so it sometimes makes a big difference to
   define the constants directly rather than in terms of other
   constants.  Similar things can be done for other word sizes.

   The following switches say whether to use the system-provided
   library routines rather than the emulated versions in the Scheme
   sources.  The library routines should be more accurate and probably
   more efficient.

   HAS_FLOOR should be defined if the system has the double-precision
   procedures floor and ceil.  On Unix, look for floor(3M).

   HAS_FREXP should be defined if the system has the double-precision
   procedures ldexp and frexp.  On Unix, look for frexp(3C).

   HAS_MODF should be defined if the system has the double-precision
   procedure modf.  On Unix, look for frexp(3C).  **** This flag is
   new as of 22-SEP-89; please comment out any incorrect #define's as
   we haven't been able to test this on all machines.

/* Possible values for FASL_INTERNAL_FORMAT.  For the most part this
   means the processor type, so for example there are several aliases
   for 68000 family processors.  This scheme allows sharing of
   compiled code on machines with the same processor type.  Probably
   we will have to create a more powerful method of identifying FASL
   files when we introduce new differences, such as whether or not a
   68881 coprocessor is installed. */
