;;;; Register Allocator

(declare (usual-integrations))

#|

The register allocator provides a mechanism for allocating and
deallocating machine registers.  It manages the available machine
registers as a cache, by maintaining a ``map'' which records two kinds
of information: (1) a list of the machine registers which are not in
use; and (2) a mapping which is the association between the allocated
machine registers and the ``pseudo registers'' which they represent.

An ``alias'' is a machine register which also holds the contents of a
pseudo register.  Usually an alias is used for a short period of time,
as a store-in cache, and then eventually the contents of the alias is
written back out to the home it is associated with.  Because of the
lifetime analysis, it is possible to identify those registers which
will no longer be referenced; these are deleted from the map when they
die, and thus do not need to be saved.

A ``temporary'' is a machine register with no associated home.  It
is used during the code generation of a single RTL instruction to
hold intermediate results.

Each pseudo register that has at least one alias has an entry in the
map.  While a home is entered in the map, it may have one or more
aliases added or deleted to its entry, but if the number of aliases
ever drops to zero, the entry is removed from the map.

Each temporary has an entry in the map, with the difference being
that the entry has no pseudo register associated with it.  Thus it
need never be written out.

All registers, both machine and pseudo, are represented by
non-negative integers.  Machine registers start at zero (inclusive)
and stop at NUMBER-OF-MACHINE-REGISTERS (exclusive).  All others are
pseudo registers.  Because they are integers, we can use MEMV on lists
of registers.

AVAILABLE-MACHINE-REGISTERS should be a list of the registers which
the allocator is allowed to allocate, in the preferred order of
allocation.

(SORT-MACHINE-REGISTERS REGISTERS) should reorder a list of machine
registers into some interesting sorting order if that is desired.

(PSEUDO-REGISTER=? X Y) is true iff X and Y are the ``same'' register.
Normally, two pseudo registers are the same if their
REGISTER-RENUMBERs are equal.
