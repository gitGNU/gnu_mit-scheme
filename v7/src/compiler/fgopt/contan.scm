;;;; Continuation Analysis

(declare (usual-integrations))

#|

The continuation analysis is responsible for determining when static
or dynamic links are to be used.

Static links
------------

We compute the `block-stack-link' which is the set of blocks which
might be immediately adjacent (away from the top of the stack) to the
given block on the stack.  If it is possible to find the parent in a
consistent way with any one of these adjacent blocks, we do not need a
static link.  Otherwise, we set `block-stack-link' to #F and use a
static link.  Static links are currently avoided in only two cases:

- The procedure is always invoked with a continuation which does not
have the procedure's parent as an ancestor.  The only way for this to
be the case and for the procedure's block to be a stack block is if
the procedure's parent has (eventually) tail recursed into the
procedure, and thus the block adjacent on the stack is the parent's
frame.  Note that this includes the case where the continuation is
always externally supplied (passed in).

- The procedure is always invoked with a particular continuation which
has the procedure's parent as an ancestor.  The parent frame can then
be found from the continuation's frame.  The adjacent block is the
continuation's block.

Remarks:

This analysis can be improved in the following way: Multiple
continuations as in the second case above are fine as long as the
parent can be obtained from all of them by the same access path.

If the procedure is invoked with a particular continuation which does
not have the procedure's parent as an ancestor, we are in the presence
of the first case above, namely, the parent block is adjacent on the
stack.

Dynamic links
-------------

We compute the popping limit of a procedure's continuation variable,
which is the farthest ancestor of the procedure's block that is to be
popped when invoking the continuation.  If we cannot compute the limit
statically (value is #F), we must use a dynamic link.

This code takes advantage of the fact that the continuation variable
is not referenced in blocks other than the procedure's block.  This
may change if call-with-current-continuation is handled specially.
