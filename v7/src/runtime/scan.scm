;;;; Definition Scanner

(declare (usual-integrations))

;;; Scanning of internal definitions is necessary to reduce the number
;;; of "real auxiliary" variables in the system.  These bindings are
;;; maintained in alists by the microcode, and cannot be compiled as
;;; ordinary formals can.

;;; The following support is provided.  SCAN-DEFINES will find the
;;; top-level definitions in a sequence, and returns an ordered list
;;; of those names, and a new sequence in which those definitions are
;;; replaced by assignments.  UNSCAN-DEFINES will invert that.

;;; The Open Block abstraction can be used to store scanned
;;; definitions in code, which is extremely useful for code analysis
;;; and transformation.  The supplied procedures, MAKE-OPEN-BLOCK and
;;; OPEN-BLOCK-COMPONENTS, will connect directly to SCAN-DEFINES and
;;; UNSCAN-DEFINES, respectively.

;;;; Scanning

;;; This depends on the fact that the lambda abstraction will preserve
;;; the order of the auxiliaries.  That is, giving MAKE-LAMBDA a list
;;; of auxiliaries will result in LAMBDA-COMPONENTS returning an
;;; EQUAL?  list.
