;;; This procedure is called with the newly-created environment as its

;;; Doing (PROCEED) from within entry or exit advice will cause that
;;; particular piece of advice to be terminated, but any remaining
;;; advice to be executed.  Doing (PROCEED value), however,
;;; immediately terminates all advice and returns VALUE as if the
;;; procedure called had generated the value.  Returning from a piece
;;; of exit advice is equivalent to doing (PROCEED value) from it.
