;;;; Pathnames

(declare (usual-integrations))

;;; A pathname component is normally one of:

;;; * A string, which is the literal component.

;;; * 'WILD, meaning that the component is wildcarded.  Such
;;; components may have special meaning to certain directory
;;; operations.

;;; * #F, meaning that the component was not supplied.  This has
;;; special meaning to `merge-pathnames', in which such components are
;;; substituted.

;;; * 'UNSPECIFIC, which means the same thing as #F except that it is
;;; never defaulted by `merge-pathnames'.  Normally there is no way to
;;; specify such a component value with `string->pathname'.

;;; A pathname consists of 5 components, not all necessarily
;;; meaningful, as follows:

;;; * The DEVICE is usually a physical device, as in the Twenex `ps:'.

;;; * The DIRECTORY is a list of components.  If the first component
;;; is 'ROOT, then the directory path is absolute.  Otherwise it is
;;; relative.  Two special components allowed only in directories are
;;; the symbols 'SELF and 'UP which are equivalent to Unix' "." and
;;; ".." respectively.

;;; * The NAME is the proper name part of the filename.

;;; * The TYPE usually indicates something about the contents of the
;;; file.  Certain system procedures will default the type to standard
;;; type strings.

;;; * The VERSION is special.  Unlike an ordinary component, it is
;;; never a string, but may be either a positive integer, 'NEWEST,
;;; 'UNSPECIFIC, 'WILD, or #F.  Many system procedures will default
;;; the version to 'NEWEST, which means to search the directory for
;;; the highest version numbered file.

;;; This file requires the following procedures and variables which
;;; define the conventions for the particular file system in use:
;;; (symbol->pathname symbol)
;;; (pathname-parse string (lambda (device directory name type version)))
;;; (pathname-unparse device directory name type version)
;;; (pathname-unparse-name name type version)
;;; (pathname-as-directory pathname)
;;; working-directory-package
;;; (access reset! working-directory-package)
;;; init-file-pathname
;;; (home-directory-pathname)
;;; (working-directory-pathname)
;;; (set-working-directory-pathname! name)

;;; See the files unkpth.scm, vmspth.scm, or unxpth.scm for examples.
