;;; (DISK-SAVE  filename #!optional identify)
;;; (DUMP-WORLD filename #!optional identify)
;;; Saves a world image in FILENAME.  IDENTIFY has the following meaning:
;;;
;;;    [] Not supplied => ^G on restore (normal for saving band).
;;;    [] String => New world ID message, and ^G on restore.
;;;    [] Otherwise => Returns normally (very useful for saving bugs!).
;;;
;;; The image saved by DISK-SAVE does not include the "microcode", the
;;; one saved by DUMP-WORLD does, and is an executable file.
