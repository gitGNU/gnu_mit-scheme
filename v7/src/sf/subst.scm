#| You can get some weird stuff with this

(define (foo x)
  (define (loop1) (loop2))
  (define (loop2) (loop3))
  (define (loop3) (loop1))
  (bar x))

will optimize into

(define (foo x)
  (define loop1 loop3)
  (define loop2 loop3)
  (define loop3 loop3)
  (bar x))

and if you have automagic integrations on, this won't finish
optimizing.  Well, you told the machine to loop forever, and it
determines that it can do this at compile time, so you get what
you ask for.
