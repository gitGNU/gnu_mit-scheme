;;;; SCode Optimizer: Transform Input Expression

(declare (usual-integrations))

;;; GLOBAL-BLOCK is used to handle (USUAL-INTEGRATIONS), as follows.
;;; This declaration refers to a large group of names, which are
;;; normally defined in the global environment.  Names in this group
;;; are supposed to be shadowed by top-level definitions in the user's
;;; program.

;;; Normally we would intern the variable objects corresponding to
;;; those names in the block corresponding to the outermost
;;; environment in the user's program.  However, if the user had a
;;; top-level definition which was intended to shadow one of those
;;; names, both the definition and the declaration would refer to the
;;; same variable object.  So, instead we intern them in GLOBAL-BLOCK,
;;; which never has any user defined names in it.
